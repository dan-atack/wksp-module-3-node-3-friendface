1. Clicking Friend's picture brings you to THEIR PAGE:

- keep you as current user

- keep a variable for friendBeingVisited

- bring you to a new page, friend.ejs
    when you click your friends' faces.

- friend.ejs has similar layout to main,
    but with no sidebar.

- friend.ejs has their friends at the bottom.

- Return to my face button on friend page.

2. On your page you can add friends from users.
